# Architecture decision records

This folder records heterodyne's architecture decisions, one decision per file, in MADR format (`NNNN-kebab-title.md`). Each record gives the context, the options considered and rejected, the outcome and its reasons, the consequences, how we confirm the decision is followed, and the evidence with the date it was checked. Details that are still undecided are written as "Open decision: ..." rather than chosen.

## Process

Every design choice that brings a constant or a non-obvious default into heterodyne is, before it is built, either traced to a spec requirement, recorded here as an ADR, or asked of the product owner first; until the owner answers, it is written down as "Open decision" and never presented as design (ADR 0001). In Go, golangci-lint's `mnd` linter enforces "no unexplained constants" by failing on unnamed number literals, and each named constant cites the spec requirement, ADR or open decision it comes from. Every subagent brief forbids unexplained constants and requires the subagent to list the decisions it made in its report. New ADRs are written with status `proposed`; the product owner changes the status to `accepted`, and a decision that changes gets a new ADR that supersedes the old one.

Note: the owner named the product heterodyne on 2026-10-17 (it was briefly hivedeck); the GitHub organisation is heterodyne-labs. These records use those names throughout.
