# Living specs under openspec/specs/ may change only in a range that also adds an
# archived change under openspec/changes/archive/ (ADR 0004). Adapted from the 05 PoC.
#
# usage: scripts/check-specs.sh [base-ref] [head-ref]
#   defaults: origin/main and HEAD. CI passes the PR's base and head; the range is
#   base...head (from the merge base), so the clone needs enough history for
#   git merge-base (actions/checkout with fetch-depth: 0).
#
# Limit (from the 05 PoC): any added file under changes/archive/ counts as proof;
# the script does not check that the archive matches the spec diff.
